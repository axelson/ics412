</h2>

<b><font face="sans-serif"> Team Project </font></b><br>
This is a project to do in a team of three students. The motivation
is that working with somebody is always a good experience, and that
the project is sufficiently complicated to justify a 3-student team.
You can divide the work among team members as you wish.  A team can (and
is encouraged to) engage in <b>general</b> discussions with other teams
regarding the project, but specific details of a solution, including
the solution itself, must <b>always</b> be the team's own work. (See
the statement of Academic Dishonesty on the course's syllabus.) </p>

<b><font face="sans-serif"> What to turn in? </font></b><br> 
Turn in an archive (.zip, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, etc.) that contains:
<ul>
<li> The <tt>thread</tt> directory from the Nachos distribution (in which you have modified some of the Java code).
<li> The top-level <tt>Makefile</tt> file from the Nachos distribution, if you have modified it.
<li> You answers to Question #2 in a text file.
</ul>
The archive must be turned in via e-mail to <a
href="mailto:henric@hawaii.edu">henric@hawaii.edu</a> <b>and</b> to <a
href="mailto:altunkay@hawaii.edu">altunkay@hawaii.edu</a> with a subject
line like "ICS412: PROJ#1" before 11:59PM on the day the project is due.

<b><font face="sans-serif"> Getting Started with the Nachos Project #1</font></b><br>
The slides presented and discussed in class are available: 
<a href="../slides/ics412_proj1.ppt">[PPT]</a>, 
<a href="../slides/ics412_proj1.pdf">[PDF]</a>.

<p>
<b><font face="sans-serif"> Downloading and Installing Nachos</font></b><br>
<ul>
<li> Download <a href="./nachos-java-proj1.zip">nachos-java-proj1.zip</a> on your system.
<li> Unpack the archive in whatever directory: <tt>unzip nachos-java-proj1.zip</tt>
<li> Change directory: <tt>cd nachos/proj1</tt>
<li> Type <tt>make</tt>
<li> Verify that Nachos is successfully built by running it: <tt>../bin/nachos</tt>
  <ul>
    <li> You should see a "*** Nachos Kernel Successfully Started ***" message.
  </ul>
</ul>

In this project you're only adding/modifying source code in the
<tt>thread</tt> directory. If you add a new source file in that directory,
then you must (trivially) modify the top-level Makefile and turn it in
as well.  <b>Do not</b> modify code anywhere else (since you don't turn
it in).

<b>Reading the <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp09/Nachos/walk/">Nachos for Java Walkthrough</a>, and in particular its
<a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp09/Nachos/walk/x170.html">Threads and Scheduling Section</a> is probably a very good idea.</b>

<b><font face="sans-serif"> Question #1: Adding Simple Testing [10pts] </font></b><br>

Implement the <tt>KThreadSimpleTest.java</tt> class (right now it's
an empty placeholder). That class should create 2 KThread objects and
start them. Threads should be named <tt>HelloWorldThread-1</tt> and
<tt>HelloWorkdThread-2</tt>, and should each print "Hello World!" to
the screen. Do not remove the <tt>KThread.yield()</tt> call in
<tt>KThreadSimpleTest.java</tt>. It is there so that the machine does
not halt before the two test threads have a chance to print out
their message to the console. You can look at other Test classes for
inspiration.

<p><i>(My solution takes ~45 lines of code, including comments and debug messages, not counting testing)</i>

<p>
<b><font face="sans-serif"> Question #2: Reading the Code [8pts] </font></b><br>

Answer the following questions and the code in KThread.java. The goals here is
for you to read the code and the comments therein.
<ul>

<li> When does the Kernel get rid of the TCB for a thread that has
     completed? Do not answer "at line xxx" or "in method xxx", but
     in terms of OS events (e.g., "When a new thread is forked", "When interrupts
     are enabled", "When the ready queue becomes empty")

<li> Why is the <tt>sleep()</tt> method static, while the
     <tt>ready()</tt> method isn't? 

<li> Why is there that call to <tt>ready()</tt> in the <tt>fork()</tt> method?

<li> At which line in KThread.java is the CPU scheduler called to decide
     which KThread should be given the CPU?

</ul>


<hr>
<p>
<b><font face="sans-serif"> Question #3: Implementing join() [20pts]</font></b><br>
Implement the <tt>KThread.join()</tt> method. Calling this method
allows for a thread to block until another thread is done (just like
<tt>pthread_join()</tt>).  Multiple threads can call <tt>join()</tt> on
the same thread, and they are all unblocked when that thread terminates.
Of course, a thread must finish executing normally whether or not it
is joined.
<p>
<i>Hint:</i> To implement join() you need to write code elsewhere in the code.
When a thread calls join(), it may block. The code to unblock it obviously
is not in join() but elsewhere in the Kernel. Shouldn't be too hard to figure
out.
<p>
For this question you're given a tester in KThreadTest.java. You can run it by
uncommenting the call to <tt>KThread.selfTest()</tt> in <tt>ThreadedKernel.java</tt>.

<p>
<b><font face="sans-serif"> Question #4: Implementing Condition Variables [40pts]</font></b><br>
Implement condition variables directly, by using interrupt enable and
disable to provide atomicity. We have provided a sample implementation
that uses semaphores; your job is to provide an equivalent implementation
without directly using semaphores (you may of course still use locks,
even though they indirectly use semaphores). Once you are done, you
will have two alternative implementations that provide the exact same
functionality. Your second implementation of condition variables must
reside in class <tt>nachos.threads.Condition2</tt>.
<p>
For this question you're given a tester in Condition2Test.java. You can run it by
uncommenting the call to <tt>Condition2.selfTest()</tt> in <tt>ThreadedKernel.java</tt>.


<p><i>(My solution takes ~130 lines of code, including comments and debug messages, not counting testing)</i>

<hr>
<p>
<b><font face="sans-serif"> Question #5: Implementing waitUntil() [30pts]</font></b><br>
Complete the implementation of the <tt>Alarm</tt> class, by implementing
the <tt>waitUntil(long x)</tt> method. A thread calls <tt>waitUntil()</tt>
to suspend its own execution until time has advanced to at least now +
x. This is useful for threads that operate in real-time, for example, for
blinking the cursor once per second. There is no requirement that threads
start running immediately after waking up; just put them on the ready
queue in the timer interrupt handler after they have waited for at least
the right amount of time. Do not fork any additional threads to implement
<tt>waitUntil()</tt>; you need only modify <tt>waitUntil()</tt> and the
timer interrupt handler. <tt>waitUntil()</tt> is not limited to one thread;
any number of threads may call it and be suspended at any one time.
<p>
For this question you're have to develop a tester, following the model
of the other testers, and explain how your tester does indeed provide
confidence that implementation of <tt>waitUntil()</tt> works. (Worth 10pts).

<p><i>(My solution, not counting the tester, takes ~50 lines of code, including comments and debug messages, not counting testing)</i>

<p>
<b><font face="sans-serif"> Question #6: Implementing Rendez-Vous [40pts]</font></b><br>
Implement synchronous send and receive of one word messages (also
known as rendez-vous), using condition variables (do NOT use
semaphores!). Implement the <tt>Communicator</tt> class with the following
two operations:
<ul>
<li> <tt> void speak(int word)</tt>, and
<li> <tt> int listen()</tt>.  
</ul>
<tt>speak()</tt> atomically waits until <tt>listen()</tt> is called on
the same <tt>Communicator</tt> object, and then transfers the word over to
<tt>listen()</tt>. Once the transfer is made, both can return. Similarly,
<tt>listen()</tt> waits until <tt>speak()</tt> is called, at which point
the transfer is made, and both can return (<tt>listen()</tt> returns the
word). Your solution should work even if there are multiple speakers and
listeners for the same <tt>Communicator</tt> (note: this is equivalent to
a zero-length bounded buffer; since the buffer has no room, the producer
and consumer must interact directly, requiring that they wait for one
another). Each communicator should only use exactly one lock. If you're
using more than one lock, you're making things too complicated.
<p>
For this question you're given a tester in CommunicatorTest.java. You can run it by
uncommenting the call to <tt>Communicator.selfTest()</tt> in <tt>ThreadedKernel.java</tt>.
