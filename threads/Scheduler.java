     * "priority" to the thread that has access to whatever is being guarded by
     * the queue. This is the mechanism used to partially solve priority
     * inversion.
     *
     * <p>
     * If there is no definite thread that can be said to have "access" (as in
     * the case of semaphores and condition variables), this parameter should
     * be <tt>false</tt>, indicating that no priority should be transferred.

     * The processor is a special case. There is clearly no purpose to donating
     * priority to a thread that already has the processor. When the processor
     * wait queue is created, this parameter should be <tt>false</tt>.
     *
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, it is beneficial to donate priority. For example, a lock has
     * a definite owner (the thread that holds the lock), and a lock is always
     * released by the same thread that acquired it, so it is possible to help
     * a high priority thread waiting for a lock by donating its priority to
     * the thread holding the lock. Therefore, a queue for a lock should be
     * created with this parameter set to <tt>true</tt>.
     *
     * <p>
     * Similarly, when a thread is asleep in <tt>join()</tt> waiting for the
     * target thread to finish, the sleeping thread should donate its priority
     * to the target thread. Therefore, a join queue should be created with
     * this parameter set to <tt>true</tt>.
     *
     * @param	transferPriority	<tt>true</tt> if the thread that has
     *					access should receive priority from the
     *					threads that are waiting on this queue.
